Overview of the Task: Java Application to Consume a Public REST API


The task involves creating a Java-based application that interacts with a public REST API to retrieve and display data in a structured and user-friendly format.

Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown:

Key Objectives

API Integration:

Utilize a public REST API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NASA APIs, or any other public data source).

Establish a connection to fetch data.

**Data Parsing:**

Process the JSON response from the API.
Extract relevant information for display.

**Data Presentation:**

Format the extracted data and present it in a structured and readable way (e.g., console output or GUI).

Development 

**Choose a Public REST API:**

Select a publicly available API that provides useful and interesting data. 

**For example:**

Weather data (OpenWeatherMap).

Currency exchange rates (ExchangeRate-API).

Space and astronomy data (NASA APIs).

**Set Up the Environment:**

Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred editor.

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed (e.g., Java Development Kit - JDK).

**Implement API Request:**

Use Java's networking classes (HttpURLConnection) or libraries like OkHttp or Apache HttpClient to send API requests.

**Parse JSON Response:**

Extract meaningful data using a JSON processing library (e.g., org.json, Jackson, or Gson).

**Display Data:**

Format and present the extracted information in a readable manner (e.g., tabular format or plain text).

**Test the Application:**

Test with various inputs (e.g., different cities for a weather app) to ensure correctness and robustness.

Example Use Case

**Fetching Weather Data:**

The user enters a city name.

The application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather details.

The application processes the response to extract key details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

The data is displayed in a neat format.

**Outcomes**

By the end of the task, you will have:


Gained experience in making API requests and handling responses

Learned how to parse and manipulate JSON data in Java.

Built a functional application that retrieves real-world data dynamically.

This task provides a solid foundation in Java programming, REST API integration, and data handling, which are essential skills for modern software development.
